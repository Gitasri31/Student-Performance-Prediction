# Student Performance Predictive Model

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on academic, attendance, and demographic factors using a Decision Tree classifier.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

## 📌 Dataset

This project uses the **Student Performance Data Set** from Kaggle.

## Requirements
Install dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Study hours per week
- Attendance rate
- Past exam scores
- Parental education level
- Internet access at home
- Extracurricular activities

## Model
- Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Results
The model achieved approximately 89% accuracy. Feature importance analysis shows attendance rate, past exam scores, and study hours are the most influential factors.

## Conclusion
The model helps identify key academic factors affecting student performance and can be used for early intervention strategies.
